- **Directive:** Sets goals and provide guidance.
    - *EU Directive:* Sets goals for EU member states, which must create national laws to achieve the objectives.
    - *National Directive:* Sets goals and provides guidance, but is usually not legally binding unless transformed into laws or regulations.
- **Regulation:** Applies directly in all EU countries without the need for national implementation.
